Known issues and workarounds for OpenXT v6.0.0


==== Ubuntu 15.10 (and later) DVD VM boot failure.

Ubuntu Live and Full insall DVDs fail to boot in VMs.

Workaround:

Use the Ubuntu MinimalCD network installation:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/MinimalCD

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-431

==== Broadcom NetXtreme M5722 Ethernet PCI Pass-through.

This NIC is known to cause BSODs in Windows guests and cannot currently
be used for pass-through in OpenXT.

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-453

==== Anaconda installer failure during VM installation.

This effects distributions that use Anacond (e.g. Fedora and CentOS). The
underlying problem is an interoperability issue between the guest device
model and the bochs_drm driver that is being loaded during the install.

- Workaround to install CentOS in graphics mode:
* Press tab on the CD bootloader
* Add " bochs_drm.blacklist=yes" to the kernel command line
* Press enter
* Once the installer starts, switch on eth0 in "NETWORK & HOST NAME"
* Install
- Workaround to install Fedora in graphics mode:
* Press tab on the CD bootloader
* Add " bochs_drm.fbdev=false" to the kernel command line
* Press enter
* Once the installer starts, switch on eth0 in "NETWORK & HOST NAME"
* Install

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-485

==== The CD auto-assign feature is disabled for the 6.0 release.

CDROM auto-assign has been completely disabled, as well as the "CDROM install"
option in the VM creation wizard. The only way to assign a CDROM to a guest
is to do so manually in the Devices window. The "Always Us With This VM" option
defaults to true, implying that assignments will persist across reboots,
enabling guests to boot to CDROMs.

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-635

==== TXT/Measure Launch unusable on certain systems.

This may not be an exhaustive list but these are the systems where TXT and
Measured Launch is known not to work:

- Dell Venue - unknown firmware version
- Dell 7450 - A13 firmware version

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-388

==== Windows Update performance issues and hangs in Windows 7 guests.

This is not an OpenXT issue but rather a Windows Update issue that occurs on
bare metal installs as well. This is covered here to aid uses in getting
Windows Update to work. See the following Wiki with details on how to
accomplish this:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DC/Installing+Windows+7

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-423

==== Pass-through devices must be removed from VMs before physically removed.

TODO

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-687

==== Cannot install VM from any CD drive during new VM setup.

Because of changes to the behavior of CD auto-assignment (see above), a newly
created VM cannot be started from a CD on the final page of the new VM wizard.

Workaround:

- Create a VM, on the final page, select "Create VM & Instal OS later"
- In Devices, assign the CD-ROM to the VM, make sure "Always Use With This VM" is checked
- Start the VM

Ticket:

https://openxt.atlassian.net/browse/OXT-661

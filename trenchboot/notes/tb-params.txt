---- Trenchboot Parameters ----

This is a listing of the various parameters that the GRUB loader will need to
setup in a number of places for the post launch environment and the IL kernel.

-- Linux Bootparams --

Also known as the zero page. The code in grub-core/loader/i386/linux.c is
primarily used to set these up. They are defined in include/grub/i386/linux.h
by:

struct linux_kernel_params

This must match the boot params defined in the kernel including adding the new
Trenchboot params (see below). Note the e820 memory map is populated here as
well.

TODO: It is not clear yet how to share this code since Trenchboot will need to
do all the same things and more.

TODO: It is not clear how the system memory map which from EFI which could be
bigger is handled in the fixed size e820. The EFI stub code in the kernel uses
the boot param setup_data to handle the overflow but GRUB does not seem to use
it. The file grub-core/efiemu/mm.c may have the answer - it looks like it is
where the EFI map is turned into the GRUB map after EBS.

-- Trenchboot Bootparams --

The folloing specific Trenchboot values need to be setup in the boot params:

tb_entry: This is actually filled in by the build tool at IL kernel build time
          and is read by GRUB to know where the protected mode Trenchboot stub
          entry point location is. GRUB uses this to calculate code32_start.

tb_min_ram: Special value for setting up the low PMR - much like the one in
            TBOOT.

tb_flags: Currently there are none that are settable by GRUB so it should just
          be zeroed.

tb_xbi: The extended multiboot 2 structure that is passed to the IL kernel
        containing all boot information for starting the real kernel.

The other values are used elsewhere, e.g. the landing zone fills in tb_dev_map.

-- TXT Heap Params --

The TXT heap has an area called the OS to MLE data structure that is used to
pass values from pre to post launch. There is only one that GRUB must set:

zero_page_addr: 32 bit address of the zero page in low memory.

-- LZ Header --

The LZ header is offset 4 bytes in the landing zone. It has the following
fields that GRUB must setup:

trenchboot_loader_size: The total size of the IL used to hash the IL into
                        PCR 17 in the LZ.

zero_page_addr:  32 bit address of the zero page in low memory.

msb_key_hash: TODO Daniel has to fill this in.

Some Notes:
-------------------------------------

Big questions:
 - What about the shared page?
 - What about S3 hooks?
 - What are we passing in the OS-MLE data?
 - How to handle and measure cmdlines for other boot modules?
 - What post launch things need to be checked for SKINIT

boot.S:
--------------------
  Taken care of in the tb_stub code.

begin_launch():
--------------------

tboot_parse_cmdline():
  What to do with the command lines from GRUB. The TBOOT one gets put in the MLE
  and measured by TXT.

get_tboot_call_racm_check():
  Dunno?

if ( !(rdmsr(MSR_APICBASE) & APICBASE_BSP) )
  Taken care of in tb_stub

copy_e820_map():
  To use and adjust. Not sure?

tpm_detect()
  I think this has already been done in the GRUB TB code

verify_IA32_se_svn_status()
  TXT only. Not sure where it should happen.

set_policy():
apply_policy(err):
  TXT only. Do we do anything with the VL policy?

launch_racm():
  Dunno. Seems like this is pre-launch only since it never returns.

supports_txt():
  The GRUB bits must have done that.

txt_display_errors():
  I would guess this is something we can do later in the IL kernel
  once logging is operational.

verify_platform():
  The GRUB bits must have done that.

verify_loader_context():
  Not sure how other modules are going to be passed to IL.

post_launch():
--------------------

txt_post_launch():
  txt_post_launch_verify_platform():
    Verify heap seems like something we can do later
    Verify MTRRs. What to do about passig MTRRs?
    Verify PMRs seems like something we can do later

  Clear error regs

  txt_wakeup_cpus():
    I believe we will do this very differently in the SMP bringup code
      without putting APs in mini guests.

  Restore MSR_IA32_MISC_ENABLE
  restore_mtrrs():
    With both of these we may have to find the right place in the kernel
      code to do this.

  apply_policy():
    I suspect our policy handling will be very different and not happen
      here.

  TXTCR_CMD_SECRETS
    Have to read about, not sure when to do it.

  TXTCR_CMD_OPEN_LOCALITY1
    Have to read about, not sure when to do it.

save_vtd_dmar_table():
  Not sure why this is done along with restore_vtd_dmar_table()

remove_txt_modules():
  My guess is that the GRUB bits will figure out what ACM to use
    and this routine is meamingless because it is about the MBI
